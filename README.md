# Ancient Things

## Description

This project contains collection of my artwork dealing with the
depiction of a small set of simple abstractions drawn in a style that
attempts to mimic prehistoric paintings, somewhat inspired by the artistic
styles from
[Altamira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Altamira),
[Lascaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux) and
[Chauvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave) cave sites, among others.

## Details

The icons are drawn in Support Vector Graphics (SVG) format using the
free web-based version of [SketchPad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/). There are two types of
drawings:

*  *Pen* drawings under [svg/pen](svg/pen) directory: These are produced
  with the `pen` tool. These are relatively complex drawings with paths consisting
  of many segments.
*  *Pencil* drawings under [svg/pencil](svg/pencil) directory: These are produced
  with the `pencil` tool. These drawings are meant to be significantly simpler in
  terms of detail than the `pen` ones above.

> **Note** The reasons for choosing either of the styles depends on
    the end application. In certain situations simpler drawings may be
    more applicable.
